My racaster practice

https://github.com/wdanxna/TinyDoom/assets/4746626/f17d42be-257c-492b-ac44-ff59fcff9134

technical difficulties:
- wall drawing fish-eye correction (by calculating correct depth)
- player facing angle extra peroids removal (awalys keep angles between (pi, -pi) helps alot)
- monster rendering and with proper culling
